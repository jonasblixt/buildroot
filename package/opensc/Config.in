  Open source smart card tools and middleware.
  OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart
  cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic
  operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such as
  authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures. OpenSC
  implements the standard APIs to smart cards, e.g. PKCS#11 API,
  Windowsâ€™ Smart Card Minidriver and macOS CryptoTokenKit.
